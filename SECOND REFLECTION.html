<h1 align="center" ><u><i>ೄྀ࿐ ˊˎ-SECOND QUARTER REFLECTION༉‧₊˚.</i></u></h1>
<p align="center">Oh. my. gosh. What the heck is happening right now. <br><br>
I really thought 2nd quarter was going to be atleast a <i>little</i> bit easier since we went through 1st quarter, but oh boy, was I wrong. Not only have assignments and lessons been harder to grasp (for all subjects), but climate change wants to kill us before 30. So many suspensions have led to so. Many. <b>Delays.</b> It's stressful on <u>all</u> of us.<br><br>
For ICT, I think I'm doing pretty well on the written tests. It's easy to comprehend information since everything connects and flows so naturally. <i>Practical tests</i>, however, may be my downfall. Sometimes a code buffers and I don't understnad why. More often than not, it's a <u><i>small</i></u> error too! Like a missing quotation mark or property. Frankly, it's frustrating to deal with, but I understand why it's necessary. I'm just glad the periodicals are multiple choice.<br> Anyways. I'm sick while finishing up this portfolio but oopsies! There's a <u>deadline</u> so I don't really have a choice. Thank you for listening to my very short, very sweet, a little bit mad rant as a reflection. </p>
