<p align="center">: ̗̀➛In my opinion, first quarter is always the hardest. We struggle to adjust to our new teachers, classmates, lessons, classrooms; and in such a short amount of time. It didn't help that I got many, many, many warnings from my ate's and kuya's that grade 9 would be hard. They were right. <br>
Honestly: I was pretty sure I wasn't going to survive first quarter. Starting day 1, we were bombarded with so. many. new. <u>EXPECTATIONS!!</u> And a lesson <del>(courtesy of Sir Santos)</del>! It was extremely stressful. Schoolworks, groupworks, tests, the list goes on forever. But, of course, we Lapiscians adapt very quickly. I caught up to the lessons. Though, I still find myself struggling most times.<br><br>
But I've found a new friend group! Mykee, Maverick, Jaz, Cai, and luke! We all eat lunch together and are very tight knit. Jaz has been my close friend since grade 8, Luke a friend since grade 7, while the other three only this year! I really hope we remain friends even way after grade 9 is over.</p>
